# 1. Create a parent class Vehicle with attributes like brand and model. Implement a subclass Car that adds an attribute num_doors. Write methods to display the details of both parent and child classes.
# 2. Define a class Shape with a method area that raises a NotimplementedError. Create subclasses Rectangle and Circle that implement the area() method.
# 3. Write a Python program where a class Animal has a method make_sound). Create subclasses Dog, Cat, and Cow that override the make_sound method to print their respective sounds.
# 4. Create a class Person with attributes name and age. Derive a class Employee from Person that adds employee_id and salary Implement methods to display details for both classes.
# 5. Write a function play_sound(animal) that takes an object of any subclass of Animal and calls its sound() method. Create subclasses of Animal to demonstrate polymorphism.
# 6. Define a base class Appliance with a method turn_on). Create subclasses Washing Machine, Refrigerator, and Microwave that override the tum_on() method. Write a program to demonstrate calling the method for different objects using a loop.
# 7. Write a program with a base class Shape and subclasses Square, Triangle, and Circle. Implement a method draw in each subclass and demonstrate polymorphism using a loop to call draw on a list of shapes.
# 8. Create a class hierarchy for Transport with subclasses Airplane, Ship, and Car. Each subclass should override a method move(). Write a program to demonstrate polymorphism.
